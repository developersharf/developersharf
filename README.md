# About Me

**Currently Working On**  
Building scalable web systems with **Django**, **Bootstrap**, and **REST APIs** — turning ideas into functional, fast, and well-structured applications. Alongside client projects in **WordPress**, I’m focused on refining how products feel and perform at a technical level.

**Looking to Collaborate On**  
Projects that involve deep problem-solving, system design, and backend architecture — especially with student teams or freelance partners working on meaningful digital solutions.

**Currently Learning**  
Mastering **Django backend development**, designing clean and efficient **REST APIs**, improving **data structure** skills, and optimizing how I work as a freelancer and engineer.

**Ask Me About**  
Structuring reliable web systems, improving backend performance, integrating APIs seamlessly, or balancing client work with technical growth.

**Fun Fact**  
LeetCode is my version of mental training — I solve problems for clarity, not competition. Outside of that, I’m working toward becoming the kind of developer who turns complex ideas into clean, functional realities.
